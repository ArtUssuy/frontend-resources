# Frontend-Resources <a name="top"></a>

A collection of all the resources I use to keep up with the latest in front-end web development - Tom McGurl [@RickNasty13](https://twitter.com/ricknasty13)

Front-end Web Development is rapidly growing and changing. Sometimes it's tough to keep up with all of the libraries and frameworks out there. As a lead javascript developer at my company, I'm often approached by co-workers and friends who are looking to get into front-end development or polish their skills. I decided to make this repo to list all of the great resources I use everyday to keep up to date and to learn about all the awesome things happening on the web!

Inspired by all the [awesome lists on Github](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) (also see the [Repositories section](#repos))

    + See [MEAN Stack](#mean)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
    +  NPM comes with Nodejs
    +  NPM is amazing.
    +  It is used to manage project dependecies using a little file called package.json
    +  NPM is quickly becoming a core element in front-end web development and in my opinion a driving force for javascripts success
    +  With tools like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) you can now use NPM to manage your browser and nodejs dependencies

    +  MEAN Stack is a full-stack solution that stands for:
        *  [MongoDB](link)
        *  [ExpressJS](link)
        *  [Angular](#ajs)
        *  [NodeJS](#node)
    +  With MEAN you can use javascript across your entire stack
    +  MongoDB uses JSON for document storage, Node is javascript on the server, express is a library for setting up a REST endpoint with node, and Angular is the javascript framework for your client.
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
    + Firebase is a backend as a service
    + Firebase let's you store and sync data in real-time
- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
    + Build native applcations using React and javascript
    + This is truely an awesome concept.
    + This does not create a wrapper around a UIWebview, but instead uses React Components to render native applivation views.
    + For now it only supports iOS.
    + Check out my [post](#react-native-post) below on it.
- [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) <a name="aurelia"></a>
    + Aurelia is a new framework from [Rob Eisenberg](http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/)
    + Aurelia uses the latest javascript concepts such as ES6 (or now ES2015), web components and object.observe. 
    + Also has adaptive binding
    + Definitely worth checking out.
- [ECMAScript6 A.K.A ES6 (Now ES2015)](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
    + ES6 is the latest standard for Javascript
    + The link above documents the features that make up ES6
    + ES6 is expected to be ratified in June 2015 - likehoban/es6features
    + You can start writing your applications in ES6 today by using a transpiler. The most popular right now are:
        * Babel (see bellow)
        * [Google's Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) <a name="babel"></a>
    + Babel is a javascript compiler.
    + It allows you to use next generation Javascript standards such as ES6 (ES2015) and later javascript standards today
    + It does this by _transpiling_ your ES6+ code into ES5 javascript so that it can work in browsers today.

## What I'm learning this week
I've decided to add a section covering what topics I'm looking into on a weekly basis. I'm putting it here for now until I move some of this over to a blog.

#### Week of:
- __April 5__
    This week I do not have much to update since I was on vacation. During that time however, I managed to start my React-Native User's demo discussed in last week's post. The repo is [Users-Demo-React-Native](https://github.com/tommcgurl/Users-Demo-React-Native). You can read the details of it in last weeks post.
    
    So far I've managed to complete a good portion of the application. Most of the basic functionality is complete and I hope to finalize the functionality and spruce it up a bit in my next commits. I'm thinking about extending it a bit further than originally planned in order to display the use of Flux and more CRUD operations. So far I'm very pleased with React Native, and it has been really fun to use.

    During my vacation flight to Austin, TX, I read some awesome articles on ES6 and I started looking into the transpiler [Babel](#babel). I plan on using this in future development so that I can begin working with ES2015. It already has support for JSX and React and has plugins for all the major build systems.

    Also, the Codewinds podcast came back finally! I listend to the two most recent episodes. [Episode 14](http://codewinds.com/podcast/014.html) simply covers the reason for the long hiatus. In [Episode 15](http://codewinds.com/podcast/015.html) talks to Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence about ReactJS!

- __March 29__   <a name="react-native-post"></a>
    
    This past week Facebook released [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/). I decided to try it out and was very impressed. For those that have not heard, React native is a way to build native applications using React and javascript. This does not involve the UIWebview. It instead uses the fact that React is decoupled from the DOM, to allow components to render to native views such as iOS(only platform supported at the moment). 

    I followed the 'getting started' guide and the walkthrough for creating a ListView movie application. I was extremely impressed at how easy it was to use. There were a few things that are unique to React Native as expected, but they are easy to pick up once you have some experience with ReactJS. I decided to start a demo repo where I expand upon the movies application. It's called [Users-Demo-React-Native](https://github.com/tommcgurl/Users-Demo-React-Native). I am using the [Random User API](http://randomuser.me) from [@randomapi](https://twitter.com/randomapi) to show a master-detail view of users. I will be posting each commit as a 'step' to making the application.

- __March 22__

    This week I'm taking a look at [Angular 2.0](https://angular.io/). I have yet to catch up on all the ng-conf videos but plan on doing that by the end of the week. Scotch.io posted an article on _[The Best News From ng-Conf 2015](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/the-best-news-from-angulars-ng-conf-2015)_ a few weeks ago that does a great job summarizing the major points from the conference. I got a chance to listen to [Adventures in Angular Episode 34](http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/034-aia-live-from-ng-conf-2015), where the guys discuss the conference and it definitely got me excited. 

    I also listened to the [Angular Air episode 6](https://plus.google.com/events/cmhq7mqarkoful8u7iusbjsdjtk) with the ionic team. They talk about their excitement for Angular 2 and how they are working closely with the angular team while working on Ionic 2. As someone who loves to use Ionic, I'm super excited to see what it's next version has in store. Check out this [blog post](http://ionicframework.com/blog/angular-2-ionic/) from the [Ionic blog](http://ionicframework.com/blog/) that goes into more detail on Angular 2 and Ionic 2.
    
    Angular 2 definitely looks like it packs some changes and I have to take a deeper look before commenting on them. On the surface it looks like it has some serious preformance improvements which I'm always down for. I do like the idea that Angular 2.0 will embrace ES6 and web components. I think this is great for the future of web and for pushing standards. I've started using customer elements (one part of the web component spec) at my job and it helped me solve a unique problem with some ease and elegance. I'm definitely excited to check out and start using Angular 2.
