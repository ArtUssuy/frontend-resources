# Frontend-Resources <a name="top"></a>

A collection of all the resources I use to keep up with the latest in front-end web development - Tom McGurl [@RickNasty13](https://twitter.com/ricknasty13)

Front-end Web Development is rapidly growing and changing. Sometimes it's tough to keep up with all of the libraries and frameworks out there. As a lead javascript developer at my company, I'm often approached by co-workers and friends who are looking to get into front-end development or polish their skills. I decided to make this repo to list all of the great resources I use everyday to keep up to date and to learn about all the awesome things happening on the web!

Inspired by all the [awesome lists on Github](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) (also see the [Repositories section](#repos))

- [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
    + Awesome Javascript library from the facebook team
    + Has some great concepts and is a great alternative for any existing view layer in your MVC applicatoin
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) <a name="ajs"></a>
    + Fantastic Javascript framework, and currently the one I use the most
    + Extremely popular and a must-know right now
- [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/)
    + "A framework for creating ambitious web applications" - emberjs homepage
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and now [io.js](https://iojs.org/) as well! <a name="node"></a>
    + I'm sure almost everyone knows about Node at this point, but iojs is the latest fork of node, and created in the interest of ensureing nodejs's future moving forward.
    + I don't think I can explain it any better than the website lead in
    + A must know for Front-end developers
    + It's javascript that can run on the server!
    + You can use this to run a javscript task runner like Grunt or Gulp (see below) to make you development way more productive
    + See [MEAN Stack](#mean)
-  [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
    +  NPM comes with Nodejs
    +  NPM is amazing.
    +  It is used to manage project dependecies using a little file called package.json
    +  NPM is quickly becoming a core element in front-end web development and in my opinion a driving force for javascripts success
    +  With tools like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) you can now use NPM to manage your browser and nodejs dependencies
- Javascript Task Runners
    + You can use task runners to do things like
        * start a server
        * watch for changes in html, css, and js and refresh your browser when you save
        * Pre-process your Sass or Less and generate css
        * Create sprite sheets from images
        * So much more... 
    - There are many options, and I've listed some below try them all and choose the one that works best for you/your team
    + [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
        + An awesome javascript task runner that will make you super productive
        * Grunt take a configuration approach in which you configure your tasks using a gruntfile
    + [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) 
        * An alternative to Grunt that favors code over configuration files
        * With Gulp you write code that pipes your output into the next process and is easy to grok for those that prefer straight code over a config files
    + See also [Brocolli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) and [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
    + A scaffolding tool that can generate a project scaffold for you
    + Yeoman is awesome for hitting the ground running on any project!
    + Generate out the boilerplate code for your next project with some of the great open source generators out there
    + Here are some of my favorites
        * [Angular Fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack)
        * [Angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
        * [React-Webpack](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
    + "A package manager for the web" - bower.io
    + Bower is a package manager for all of your client-side (browser) dependencies
    + Use bower to manage your angular, jquery, or bootstrap versions for example
- [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)
    + A front end SDK written with AngularJS and UI toolkit for creating awesome hybrid mobile apps

    +  "Famo.us is a free, open source JavaScript framework that helps you create smooth, complex UIs for any screen." - famous homepage
-  [MEAN Stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN) <a name="mean"></a>
    +  MEAN Stack is a full-stack solution that stands for:
        *  [MongoDB](link)
        *  [ExpressJS](link)
        *  [AngularJS](#ajs)
        *  [NodeJS](#node)
    +  With MEAN you can use javascript across your entire stack
    +  MongoDB uses JSON for document storage, Node is javascript on the server, express is a library for setting up a REST endpoint with node, and Angular is the javascript framework for your client.
