# Frontend-Resources
A collection of all the resources I use to keep up with the latest in front-end web development

Front-end Web Development is rapidly growing and changing. Sometimes it's tought to keep up with all of the libraries and frameworks out there. As a lead javascript developer at my company, I'm often approached by co-workers and friends who are looking to get into front-end development or polish their skills. I decided to make this repo so to list all of the great resources I use everyday to keep up to date and to learn about all the awesome things happening on the web!
